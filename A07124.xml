            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14635:3"/>
Å¿triue to make their knowledge more perfect, in the diÅ¿couerie of the imperfections of other mens bodies, then of their owne: Jn like Å¿ort it is the common custome of our times; that many hopefull Gentlemen (whom Nature and Arts haue beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, with the rich treaÅ¿ures of their bountie) do endeauour to be more exact and refined, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religion, Lawes, Gouernment, Maners, Strength, and Sites of forraine Countries, then of that Kingdome wherein themÅ¿elues were borne.</p>
                  <p>But as that man is wiÅ¿e in vaine, who is not wiÅ¿e vnto himÅ¿elfe; So it is a Å¿imple grace (nay to Å¿peake plainly, it is a foule diÅ¿grace) to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (eÅ¿pecially to Å¿uch a one, as hath, or doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Å¿pend much time abroad to know the faÅ¿hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of forraine Nations) to be ignorant in the State of his owne Countrie at home. The HiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of which, affordeth as much varietie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable inÅ¿truction, to captiuate the Readers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the peruÅ¿all, as the faireÅ¿t Pictures doe contentment, when with their artificiall beauties, they doe allure mens eyes to looke and to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

foraine Countries, may first be furniÅ¿hed with a conuenient knowledge of their owne; J vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke this labour, and doe preÅ¿ent it vnto you, with this my firÅ¿t reaÅ¿on which induced me thereunto.</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> The Å¿econd reaÅ¿on of my Å¿o doing, Å¿prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of mine owne conceit; which (as J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture) deceiues me not. For, in regard that the HiÅ¿tories of this Kingdome, are frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, yea blemiÅ¿hed, by too too many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening Occurrences, and by a multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant ObÅ¿eruations (which doe much differ from the true Method, and Nature, of a well digeÅ¿ted and compoÅ¿ed Chronicle; and thereby doe extend it into a needleÅ¿Å¿e and an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length) J am reÅ¿olued that the Readers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie (to obÅ¿erue and to remember) is much weakned thereby: And that many yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who doe egerly Å¿triue to attaine to much knowledge in a Å¿hort time, doe rather bend their Studies and their courÅ¿es, to reade ouer the more narrowly contracted HiÅ¿tories of other Countries, then the voluminous DiÅ¿courÅ¿es of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to inlighten their knowledge much, by reading this little; J haue thruÅ¿t forth into the World this Å¿hort HiÅ¿torie, of the Raignes, Deeds, and Actions, of twentie of our EngliÅ¿h Kings; which J will neither praiÅ¿e, least J

wrong it by mine owne commendation; nor diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiÅ¿e, leaÅ¿t you (beleeuing mee on my word) Å¿hould thinke your time ill Å¿pent, to read what I haue written.</p>
                  <p>J know that Å¿uch as are worthily deÅ¿cended, or who by learning are made worthy, will not only winke at Å¿ome imperfections, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be gained by the reÅ¿t: but will alÅ¿o take in good part the preÅ¿entment of a Å¿mall gift; if it be deliuered with a friendly hand.

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> (who was the Å¿onne of <hi>Egeldredus,</hi> and of <hi>Goditha</hi> his wife) <hi>Harold</hi> her brother, and Å¿econd Å¿onne to the Earle <hi>Godwin,</hi> vÅ¿urped this kingdom, and cauÅ¿ed himÅ¿elfe to be crowned King, the Crowne being formerly giuen by King <hi>Edward</hi> vnto <hi>William</hi> the Å¿euenth Duke of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and baÅ¿e Å¿onne to <hi>Robert</hi> their Å¿ixt Duke. To whoÅ¿e vÅ¿e and behoofe, <hi>Harold</hi> had formerly Å¿worne to keepe the Å¿ame. Whereof, when Duke <hi>William</hi> was certainely enformed, Hee charged him (by his Letters, and by MeÅ¿Å¿engers) with his promiÅ¿e, confirmed by his Oath; and required him (in friendly Å¿ort, and without blowes) to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e him of his Crowne. But proud Ambition (arming him with a ReÅ¿olution to remaine a King in deÅ¿pight of threats, or Fortune) made him, rather to quoine diÅ¿honorable excuÅ¿es, then to giue Å¿atisfaction as hee had Å¿worne: And for anÅ¿were, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, That promiÅ¿es, and vowes raÅ¿hly made, and by compulÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as his was) eÅ¿pecially for a Kingdome, wherevnto the State had giuen no free conÅ¿ent, were not (at all) to bee regarded. And therefore (Å¿eeing the Dukes Rule and Dominions were as ample,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14635:16"/>
and as large elÅ¿ewhere, as Nature and Art had enabled him to manage, and to command) he wiÅ¿hed him to bee contented with his owne, and not aduenture to claÅ¿pe more within his hand, then he was well able to hold faÅ¿t, Nor to couet that which hee Å¿hould not enioy.</p>
                  <p>As this anÅ¿were bred DiÅ¿content: So rage began to reÅ¿olue on Armes. For the Duke (aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by his Martiall friends) leuied a Å¿trong Armie; and furniÅ¿hed it with all abiliments and neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Warre: with which (through the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of Å¿ome natiue Nobles, who adhered to his part) hee Å¿afely landed in <hi>SuÅ¿Å¿ex:</hi> where (hauing prouidently Å¿heltred himÅ¿elfe, againÅ¿t all Å¿uddaine Å¿tormes) hee challenged <hi>Harold</hi> to a Å¿ingle Combat; thereby to decide the Å¿trife, without much bloud. But <hi>Harold</hi> entertained not the Challenge; but Å¿ent him word, That to gaine, or keepe a Kingdome, it required more blowes then two could giue.<note place="margin">14. <hi>October.</hi> 1066.</note> So that (within fewe dayes after) a fierce and cruell Battaile (of the continuance of one whole day) without intermiÅ¿Å¿ion, or breathing, was fought betwixt them. But in the Euening, HAROLD, being deadly wounded with an Arrow, left both his Kingdome and his life: And Duke <hi>William</hi> (almoÅ¿t with equall loÅ¿Å¿e of his men) became Victor in the field.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Saxons</hi> Raigne ended</note>And thus ended the <hi>Saxons</hi> Raigne; which (from the firÅ¿t yeare of <hi>Hengistus,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord God foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Å¿euentie and fiue, vntill the time of this ConqueÅ¿t in the yeare of our Lord God one thouÅ¿and Å¿ixtie and Å¿ixe) had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: (Sauing that now and then, it was interrupted by the <hi>Danes</hi>) the Å¿pace of fiue hundred foureÅ¿core and eleuen yeares. The Duke (hauing thus Å¿laine <hi>Harold,</hi> and gained his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) began to raigne as King: And (on ChriÅ¿tmas day then next following) hee was crowned by <hi>Aldredus</hi> ArchbiÅ¿hop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> by the enforced conÅ¿ents of the EngliÅ¿h Nobles: Who (with an outward applauÅ¿e, but with an inward griefe and Å¿orrow) Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elues to be his Å¿ubiects; the <hi>KentiÅ¿h</hi> men excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. By whom (is hee trauailed to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e himÅ¿elfe of the Å¿trong CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Douer</hi>) he was preuented in his iourney, and compaÅ¿Å¿ed round about by valiant men of War, who (carying greene boughs in their hands, and reÅ¿embling a moouing Wood) enuironed the King, and all his followers, ere they were aware therof; And prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted manfully to die, rather then they would (by Å¿eruile baÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e) be depriued of thoÅ¿e ancient Lawes and CuÅ¿tomes, whereby their Countrie was then ruled. The King (perceiuing his owne danger,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14635:16"/>
and their reÅ¿olution) hearkned to their demaunds; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted their requeÅ¿ts, but (for their bold and valorous attempt) hee honoured them with this preheminence; That euer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the <hi>KentiÅ¿h</hi> inhabitants Å¿hould make the Vantgard of the Field.</p>
                  <p>This gained hee that Countrie,<note place="margin">The Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Policies.</note> and became Å¿ole Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne of each whole Kingdome: and ruled it as a Conqueror, with more Policie than by profitable Lawes; and with more Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie than did become the Gracious diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of a fauourable King.</p>
                  <p>For firÅ¿t of all (becauÅ¿e he preÅ¿umed, that Å¿uch as were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> did rather feare than loue, and would no longer obey, than the yoake lay heauie ouer their neckes) by receiuing HoÅ¿tages of the beÅ¿t and deareÅ¿t eÅ¿teeme, hee Å¿ecured the fidelities of Å¿uch as were either honourable, or potent, and Å¿ent them into <hi>Normandie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e Å¿uddaine force and Å¿trength Å¿hould not depriue him of Å¿o Å¿ure a meane of his Å¿afetie.</p>
                  <p>Then (to depriue the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> of all commaund, and to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them feeble, and his <hi>Normans</hi> Å¿trong) he Å¿eized their chiefeÅ¿t Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both of Honour, and of Profit, into his owne hands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them vpon Å¿trangers: Whereat the EngliÅ¿h grieued much, but found no remedie: for WeakeneÅ¿Å¿e was enforced to yeeld to Power, and vÅ¿urping Policie tyrannized ouer the OppreÅ¿Å¿ed, and bereaued them of their Right.</p>
                  <p>And (becauÅ¿e in thoÅ¿e daies the Clergie was had in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> among the people; in regard, that their authoritie was not confined within the bounds of their Spirituall IuriÅ¿dictions) hee reÅ¿olued to clip their wings, becauÅ¿e they Å¿hould no longer Å¿oare Å¿o high; and did ordaine, That from thenceforth they Å¿hould not commaund with anie Temporall Authoritie whatÅ¿oeuer.</p>
                  <p>He was not ignorant, that the hope of Libertie did oftentimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> incite Å¿uch as vnwillingly were made Å¿eruile, to watch for oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to procure their Freedome: and therefore (to preuent Å¿uch dangers as might otherwiÅ¿e enÅ¿ue) he vtterly diÅ¿armed and diÅ¿wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned all the Natiues of the Land, turning their Hopes into DeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire; and preuenting their Expectations for ReleaÅ¿ement, with the preÅ¿ent Extremitie of their Bondage. Thus weakened he Å¿uch as were truly valiant, and thus made he them to Å¿uffer much who (if they had beene at libertie) would haue beene able to repell great force.</p>
                  <p>And (becauÅ¿e the concourÅ¿e of much people might giue them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Å¿ome occaÅ¿ion, both to conferre of the eÅ¿tate which they were in,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14635:17"/>
and alÅ¿o to conÅ¿ult of the meanes of their deliuerance from their Thraldome) he debarred the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> from frequent and common meetings, eÅ¿pecially in the night: which to preuent, he cauÅ¿ed a Bell in euerie Village, Towne, and Citie, to be rong at eight of the clocke in the euening; vpon the Å¿ound whereof, all <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> men were enjoyned to couer their fire, and to keepe themÅ¿elues within their dores. And this ceremonie was, and is yet called, <hi>Couer le fiew,</hi> or the raking vp of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> To diminiÅ¿h the Nobilitie, he vÅ¿ed to tranÅ¿port them for his Warres beyond the Seas: and if they returned backe againe, then might they well perceiue, that he rather meant their deÅ¿truction, than regarded their Å¿eruice: for no reward was giuen to them, though they were valiant, nor anie Å¿hew at all was made, that their forwardneÅ¿Å¿e was accepted by the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And thus dealt he likewiÅ¿e with the vulgar Å¿ort; by whoÅ¿e man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he fought his Å¿harpeÅ¿t battailes in <hi>Normandie</hi> and in <hi>France:</hi> thereby leÅ¿Å¿ening their numbers, and making his owne power more eminent among Å¿uch, as he enforced to lament their owne misfortunes, and in vaine to meditate vpon their preÅ¿ent woe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> He alÅ¿o erected Å¿trong Forts and CaÅ¿tles in Å¿undrie places of this Realme, which were commaunded by his followers; whoÅ¿e bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneÅ¿Å¿e was Å¿uch againÅ¿t the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Nation, as that they dared not to make Å¿hew, that they repined at any thing, which wickedly they did amiÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> As long as the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> abounded in Riches, and in Wealth, he knew they were not altogether heartleÅ¿Å¿e; and therefore he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them of thoÅ¿e comforts. And (to encreaÅ¿e his owne Å¿tore) he practiÅ¿ed Å¿ubtile trickes on both eÅ¿tates: for he robbed the Clergie of all their beÅ¿t and richeÅ¿t Plate and Ornaments (which had been conÅ¿ecrated to holy vÅ¿es) alledging, That Theeues and Traiterous Rebels had hid them there, to deceiue him of his forfeitures, and Å¿ecretly to Å¿upport themÅ¿elues therewith, to his great hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> He alÅ¿o enacted and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed Å¿trait and Å¿euere Lawes, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed them in his owne Language; by meanes whereof, manie (who were of great eÅ¿tate, and of much worth) through ignorance did tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿e, and their Å¿malleÅ¿t offences were great enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title the Conquerour to the Lands and Riches which they did poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e. All which he Å¿eized on, and tooke from them, without remorÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Then he diÅ¿allowed the Patents, and the Graunts of former Kings, and publiÅ¿hed them to be meerely void; and hauing Å¿eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tred them into his owne hands, he Å¿old them againe to the true

owners for great Å¿ummes of money, if they could pay them: but otherwiÅ¿e he gaue them to his <hi>Normans,</hi> and to the <hi>French.</hi>

                  <p>As on the Sea-Å¿hore one waue Å¿ucceedes another: Å¿o in humane affaires there is no end of troubles. No Å¿ooner was this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e concluded, but another did begin.

So this vnexpected reÅ¿iÅ¿tance compelled the King to caÅ¿t his plot into a new mould, and by Å¿leight and policie to effect that, which by open violence he could not doe. Wherefore (not making himÅ¿elfe ouer-much beholding to long deliberation) he Å¿ent many of his chiefeÅ¿t Commanders into <hi>England;</hi> who (with more than ordinarie diligence and Å¿peede) in Å¿hort time waged a Å¿trong Armie of twentie thouÅ¿and men: who (being readie to be embarked) were vnexpectedly greeted with this faire offer,<note place="margin">A politike and a pleaÅ¿ing Taxe.</note> That Å¿uch of them as would Å¿euerally giue tenne Å¿hillings to the King, towards his leuying of new forces in <hi>Normandie,</hi> Å¿hould be diÅ¿miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed from that journey.

                  <p>This king was WiÅ¿e, Learned, Milde, Valiant, and IuÅ¿t, beyond moÅ¿t of his PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors; more enclined to Peace than vnto Warre: Å¿o that hee made Warre his Champion Å¿toutly to chalenge his Rights, and to reuenge his Wrongs.

He waxed rich with his owne, and yet he was very liberall: but he onely extended his bountie to Å¿uch as merited it by their publike Seruice; and hee confined his Gifts within the Limits of Thrift and of MeaÅ¿ure.

And, as he would neuer forget good Å¿eruice done, nor anie good turnes performed for him: Å¿o would he Å¿eldome, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, take reÅ¿t, vntill by Å¿ome worthie gift, or correÅ¿pondent requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, he had Å¿hewed himÅ¿elfe thankfull to Å¿uch as deÅ¿erued well.

                  <p>TheÅ¿e large and friendly proffers (which indeede proceeded rather from a jealouÅ¿ie which the <hi>French</hi> King had of himÅ¿elfe, by reaÅ¿on of King <hi>Iohns</hi> GreatneÅ¿Å¿e, than from anie inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or heartie loue which hee bare vnto <hi>Arthur,</hi> the lawfull and the rightfull Heire of this Crowne) and the longing deÅ¿ire which made this young Gallant hopefull of thoÅ¿e great atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; perÅ¿uaded him verie eaÅ¿ily, not onely to accept of the <hi>French</hi> Kings friendÅ¿hip, but alÅ¿o to vÅ¿e his aide.

                  <p>It is now to bee obÅ¿erued, that from henceforth the King reÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not the Å¿age aduice and counÅ¿ell of his graueÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Lords: and that he began careleÅ¿lely to neglect the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and his great Officers of his Kingdome: and that hee did all things prepoÅ¿terouÅ¿ly, by the lewd and vnskilfull perÅ¿waÅ¿ions and directions of his two newly-created Dukes, of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and of <hi>Alexander</hi> then ArchbiÅ¿hop of <hi>Yorke;</hi> and of <hi>Robert Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ilian</hi> his Chiefe IuÅ¿tice. And as they all did lead him into many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros: Å¿o did they eÅ¿pecially exaÅ¿perat him (without iuÅ¿t cauÅ¿e) againÅ¿t his renowned, and truly noble Vncle <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>WoodÅ¿tocke,</hi> Duke of <hi>GloceÅ¿ter;</hi> and againÅ¿t the two Earles of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and of <hi>Arondel:</hi> which three hee intended to haue Å¿urprized at a Banquet in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> if <hi>Nicholas Exton</hi> (then Major of that Citie) would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented thereunto. But becauÅ¿e his helpe then failed, and the King could not (at that time) obtaine his purpoÅ¿e: Hee reÅ¿olued to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it at a more Å¿olemne meeting. For which cauÅ¿e principally, He Å¿ummoned his High Court of Parliament: but the Å¿aid three Lords (vpon good information being jealous of Å¿uch vnkindly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) repaired to the Å¿aid aÅ¿Å¿embly; being Å¿trongly garded by a multitude of valiant men at armes: by meanes whereof they Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their own libertie; and the vngodly project of the King, and of his wicked CounÅ¿ellors, came to nought.</p>
                  <p>Now when this long Parliament produced nothing worthie to bee noted: <hi>Michael de la Pole</hi> (in the Kings behalfe) required a Tax of foure fifteenes, affirming that a leÅ¿Å¿er gift could not Å¿upport his EÅ¿tate, and maintaine Å¿uch warres as hee was likely to vndertake. But the Lords, and the Lower HouÅ¿e, not only refuÅ¿ed to yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this motion, but made a Å¿olemne declaration, That as the Kings of this Realme (for the better ordering, and preÅ¿eruing of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate, and Kingdome) might once in euery yeare aÅ¿Å¿emble a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Å¿o by an ancient law, all the members of that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell might, without leaue, breake vp the Å¿ame aÅ¿Å¿embly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to their owne houÅ¿es, If the King abÅ¿ented himÅ¿elfe from their companie for the Å¿pace of fortie dayes together; and that they would not proceed in any buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e but depart, except the King would bee pleaÅ¿ed perÅ¿onally to come among them, and to grace them with his preÅ¿ence; and would alÅ¿o remoue <hi>Michael de la Pole</hi> from his ChancelorÅ¿hip, and commit him to Å¿trait PriÅ¿on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e he lewdly counÅ¿elled the King to attempt manie thinges,

which were diÅ¿honourable to himÅ¿elfe and hurtfull to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.</p>
                  <p>The King (as a Lion) being Å¿terne, and Å¿corning to yeeld vnto anie motion, although it tended to his owne Å¿afetie,<note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies their Å¿uit</note> and to the well-fare of his people; required, that fiftie Å¿elected men of that AÅ¿Å¿embly might be Å¿ent vnto him, with whom he would conferre and agree vpon Å¿uch affaires, as they required to bee treated on.<note place="margin">They will not yeeld to his command.</note> But the two houÅ¿es (denying to make anie concluÅ¿ions priuatly, of Å¿uch affaires, and buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es, as by a Parliament were to be diÅ¿puted publickly, and publickly to be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed) did Å¿end vnto him his Å¿aid Vncle <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>WoodÅ¿tocke,</hi> Duke of <hi>GloceÅ¿ter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell</hi> then Arch-biÅ¿hop of <hi>Canterburie:</hi> and none others.

                  <p>The rendring of this Citie, and of all the aforeÅ¿aid Townes, and manie more, did much perplex and coole the courage of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgoine,</hi> who (with the diÅ¿contentment of the Nobilitie) ruled both the King and his Countries,<note place="margin">The Regent plotteth to make peace, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on his enemies.</note> feared much leaÅ¿t theÅ¿e diÅ¿aÅ¿ters would be layed vnto his charge.

                  <p n="1">1. The firÅ¿t was, the releaÅ¿ement of <hi>Lewys</hi> the noble Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> for his ranÅ¿ome. For his wiÅ¿dome inÅ¿tructed the weake

                  <p n="2">2. The Å¿econd was this vnhappie and this vnfortunate mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betwixt the King and his Queene: for by meanes thereof the Earle of <hi>Arminake,</hi> his kinÅ¿men, and his friends, became mortall enemies to the EngliÅ¿h Nation, hating them for their Kings Å¿ake, becauÅ¿e he had vnfaithfully forÅ¿aken his affied wife. And beÅ¿ides that, the King had not one penny with the Queene for her mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age portion; but Å¿pent on her many thouÅ¿and pounds before hee enioyed her as his wife. And by this match alÅ¿o the King did not Å¿trengthen himÅ¿elfe with any new friends: for her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers penurie and wants enforced him to liue almoÅ¿t as a priuate man.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. To theÅ¿e alÅ¿o may bee added the diuers diÅ¿poÅ¿itions and qualities of the King and of the Queene.<note place="margin">The deÅ¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King Henry.</note> For King <hi>Henry</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding milde, courteous, and gentle, patient in all aduerÅ¿ities, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in proÅ¿peritie, a deÅ¿piÅ¿er of couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, an hater of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion, a louer of quietneÅ¿Å¿e and of peace. Hee loathed warres, and the toile and troubles of the world: hee Å¿pent much time in his priuate Å¿tudies, and in his religious exerciÅ¿es vnto God. Hee was not deÅ¿irous to meddle much with publike affaires, nor with the gouernment of his kingdome. He deÅ¿ired not to reuenge any wrong which was done vnto him. He was more mercifull to Å¿uch as tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed, then willing to extend the rigour of iuÅ¿tice againÅ¿t Å¿uch as had offended his lawes: yea, Å¿o little reÅ¿pectfull was hee of his owne greatneÅ¿Å¿e, and of his knightly dignitie and honour, (in regard of his Å¿oules health) that hee loued rather to be ruled then to gouerne as a King.</p>
                  <p>But the young Queene (who was faire and beautifull,<note place="margin">The deÅ¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Queen Margaret.</note> Å¿trong and luÅ¿tie, proud and haughtie, Å¿tout and reuengefull, craftie and politicke) was not well pleaÅ¿ed with the Å¿oft nature and flexible diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the King: neither could her ambitious Å¿pirit endure,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14635:135"/>
that he being more then of full yeares, Å¿hould (as a pupill) be ruled and directed by another man.

                  <p>And when they perceiued that they were vnable by that courÅ¿e and practiÅ¿e to attaine vnto their purpoÅ¿e, they procured the Queene (in the Kings name) to aÅ¿Å¿emble his high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Burye,</hi> where the Å¿aid Duke (Å¿urnamed for his Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿ing and heroicall vertues,<note place="margin">He is called the good Duke of GloceÅ¿ter.

For in the next Summer before he died, hee required the Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> and his brethren to repaire to his CaÅ¿tle of <hi>WindÅ¿our,</hi> where hee then lay. And when they expected Å¿ome extraordinarie imploiment in State affaires,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14635:164"/>
becauÅ¿e Å¿o many of them were called thither, not troubling them with any buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, either great or Å¿mall, priuate or publike, nor requiring of them any Å¿upplies from their plentie, hee royally fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted, banqueted, and entertained them, not only with the choiÅ¿eÅ¿t, beÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t coÅ¿tly delicates that could bee gotten, but alÅ¿o hee gladded them vnÅ¿peakably with his owne preÅ¿ence and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-like behauiour. Hee afterwards carried them into his Parke, where the thicke fall of fat Deere (beÅ¿ides many other things) gaue them warrant of their kinde welcome. And at their departing from him, he Å¿ent Å¿uch great Å¿tore of veniÅ¿on into the Citie, for the friendly feaÅ¿ting of their neighbours there, that nothing euer won him more heartie loue among his Å¿ubiects of that place.</p>
                  <p>He left behinde him two Å¿onnes; <hi>Edward,</hi> who being of the age of thirteene yeares, vnfortunately Å¿ucceeded him in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who was two yeares younger; and fiue daughters, namely <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who afterwards maried King <hi>Henry</hi> the Å¿euenth, and was mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Cicilie, Bridget,</hi> and <hi>Katherine,</hi> whoÅ¿e fortunes Å¿eldome laughed, and <hi>Anne,</hi> who maried <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Haward,</hi> who after was created Earle of <hi>Surrey.</hi>

For he had many teeth when he was borne. He was exceedingly deformed in the compoÅ¿ure of his bodie: for of Å¿tature he was but low, crooke-backed; his left Å¿houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was much higher then the other: his viÅ¿age was vncomely, his complexion Å¿wart and browne: he was exceeding Å¿trong, yet much withered in his left arme: he was violent, fierce, and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily cruell; a good Å¿ouldier, diÅ¿creet to order well, and politicke to rule. Hee was very haÅ¿tie and forward in great expeditions and weightie actions; yet wiÅ¿e, and well aduiÅ¿ed before hee would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to fight. He was ambitious beyond meaÅ¿ure, and his deÅ¿ires for Å¿oueraigntie had no bounds. What he contriued, were it good or bad, hee would by one meanes or by another aÅ¿Å¿uredly effect it. Hee made his conÅ¿cience in all things to Å¿erue his will, though his will could not bee obtained without the effuÅ¿ion of guiltleÅ¿Å¿e bloud. He would oftentimes make himÅ¿elfe poore by his lauiÅ¿h bountie to Å¿uch as wickedly Å¿erued his turne: and would againe quickly enrich himÅ¿elfe by pilling and by polling of ciuill and of honeÅ¿t men.

                  <p>King <hi>Edwards</hi> death, and the minoritie of his two Å¿onnes,<note place="margin">Richard ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Crowne.</note> gaue him fit opportunitie to worke miÅ¿chiefe, which firÅ¿t of all he reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to proÅ¿ecute by the reuiuing of olde grudges betwixt the Queenes kindred and the Kings, although the laÅ¿t King in his death-bed had reconciled them, and made them all friends. For he knew, that where malice and hatred are of counÅ¿ell, there no good action or Å¿ound concluÅ¿ion can be expected. And by this practiÅ¿e he endeuoured firÅ¿t to make him Å¿elfe equall with the beÅ¿t, and then to be the beÅ¿t of all.</p>
                  <p>Wee muÅ¿t alÅ¿o now obÅ¿erue, that at the time of King <hi>Edwards</hi> death the young Prince in his owne perÅ¿on kept his reÅ¿idence and Court at <hi>Ludlow</hi> in the dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> that by his preÅ¿ence he might reÅ¿traine the <hi>WelÅ¿hmen</hi> from Å¿uch outragious enterpriÅ¿es as oftentimes their licentious and bad manners incited them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And the protection of his perÅ¿on was by the laÅ¿t King appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Anthonie</hi> Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> the Queenes brother, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Å¿ide Vncle to the Å¿aid Prince. And her allies and her kinÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes did now poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e all roomes and offices of honour and of profit about him, hee being King: which the Duke of <hi>GloceÅ¿ter</hi> much maligned, and Å¿o Å¿corned it, that in his conceits he contriued how he might thruÅ¿t them all out of thoÅ¿e places. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e hee oftentimes Å¿ecretly and Å¿eriouÅ¿ly conferred with <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>HaÅ¿tings,</hi> who was Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine to the laÅ¿t King. To them hee diÅ¿couered the meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cent of the Queene, and of her kinsfolkes in reÅ¿pect of theirs, and told them plainly, that if thoÅ¿e VpÅ¿tarts remained Å¿o neere vnto the King in his youth, they would (through his fauour) be Å¿o pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull when he came to his full age, that all their honours, their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, and their liues, would be in danger to be made Å¿ubiect to their willes. And therefore he aduiÅ¿ed them to ioine with him for their remoue, and to diuide and Å¿hare betwixt themÅ¿elues all Å¿uch benefits as by thoÅ¿e meanes Å¿hould be atchieued.</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e faire perÅ¿waÅ¿ions, and their owne ambitious humours,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14635:165"/>
quickly wrought the Å¿aid two great Lords,<note place="margin">His practiÅ¿e againÅ¿t the Queenes kindred.</note> not onely to hearken willingly to this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, but alÅ¿o to bee confederates with the Duke of <hi>GloceÅ¿ter</hi> in that practiÅ¿e, which quickly was attempted in this manner.</p>
                  <p>The Queene with the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> her brother, and with her Å¿onne <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and with her other friends, being guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Å¿trong power of armed men and Å¿ouldiers, intended to bring the young King from <hi>Wales</hi> towards <hi>London</hi> to be crowned. And the Duke of <hi>GloceÅ¿ter</hi> knowing that if his feat were not wrought before that time, it could not eaÅ¿ily be effected after; and conÅ¿idering likewiÅ¿e, that if he with his confederates Å¿hould come armed againÅ¿t the King to meet him, and by open violence attempt to get the Kings perÅ¿on into their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, their Å¿aid enterpriÅ¿e would be cenÅ¿ured and adiudged to be a rebellious action, and no leÅ¿Å¿e then TreaÅ¿on. Wherefore he cunningly directed and Å¿ent his letters to the Queene, and called to her remembrance the heartie loue and friendÅ¿hip which the late King her deceaÅ¿ed huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his death-bed had ratified and confirmed betwixt the Lords of his owne bloud and alliance, and the kinsfolkes of the Queene. He likewiÅ¿e informed her, that it was commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that her brother and her friends which were neere about the Kings perÅ¿on, intended with a Å¿trong power and with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men to conduct his MaieÅ¿tie (for his Coronation) from <hi>Wales</hi> to the Citie of <hi>London.</hi> He proteÅ¿ted and Å¿wore vnto her, that his humble dutie to his Soueraigne, and his vnfained loue to her and to her kinsfolkes and children, incited him Å¿eriouÅ¿ly and earneÅ¿tly to aduiÅ¿e and counÅ¿ell her and them, to diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e companies of armed men, for that he feared much leÅ¿t the gathering of them together would be the occaÅ¿ion of new broiles, and of ciuill wars. For Å¿eeing (quoth he) that many former battailes triumphing in bloud, haue now made peace, and Å¿eeing that the Å¿tate of the whole Kingdome hateth Armes, and Å¿eeing that the King hath no Competitor for his Crowne, and that loue and friendÅ¿hip hath vnited and knit together the mindes and the hearts of all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Å¿eeing that perfect tranquillitie and a Å¿ecure reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath quieted and gladded all the people, certainly the Kings comming towards the Citie of <hi>London</hi> with an armed traine, will make the Lords of the deceaÅ¿ed Kings bloud, and many others, exceeding iealous of their intention, and to be fearfull leÅ¿t Å¿ome Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret plot be cunningly contriued to Å¿urpriÅ¿e them, when in dutie and for Å¿eruice they Å¿hall make their acceÅ¿Å¿e vnto the King; and that Å¿uch feare and iealouÅ¿ie will occaÅ¿ion them (for their defence

                  <p>The Queene and her friends (who meant none ill) taking much comfort in this aduice,<note place="margin">The Kings Å¿trength is Å¿ent away.</note> becauÅ¿e Å¿he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed it Å¿prang from heartie loue, and alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e the Duke of <hi>GloceÅ¿ter</hi> had at the Å¿ame time with all reÅ¿pectiue dutie and reuerence likewiÅ¿e written vnto the King, and louingly to the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> her brother, and vnto <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> her Å¿onne, cauÅ¿ed all Å¿uch Å¿trength of armed men as was prouided for the Kings conduction towards <hi>London,</hi> to bee diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ed and Å¿ent away. And the Å¿aid Earle, and Lord, and Å¿ome others of their friends, brought the King forth in his iourney to the Citie of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Stony Stratford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten miles from thence. And becauÅ¿e that little Towne was not capable of the whole traine, the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> and his priuate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers remained that night in <hi>Northampton.</hi>

                  <p>When this round meÅ¿Å¿age was done vnto the Queene, though it Å¿o nipped her at the heart, that willingly Å¿he would not let him goe, alleadging that none but his owne mother was more fit to tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor him, or to attend him, hee being Å¿o young, Å¿ickly, and very weake; and that each of thoÅ¿e two brethren was the others Å¿afetie Å¿o long as they were kept aÅ¿under, and that the life of the one was maintained in the bodie of the other, and that if one of them did well, the other was in no perill or danger, and that nothing was more hazardous then to keepe them both in one place together: yet when Å¿hee perceiued which way the game went, and that it was reÅ¿olued by the Protector, and by his friends, that arguments Å¿hould not preuaile, Å¿hee embraced the louely young Duke in her armes, Å¿he kiÅ¿Å¿ed him many times, Å¿he wept bitterly, and praying Almightie God to preÅ¿erue and to defend him from all iniurie and dangers, Å¿he deliuered him to the Arch-biÅ¿hop, telling him, that Å¿hee would require that poore and innocent childe at his hands.

his priuitie and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, becauÅ¿e he was Å¿o mightie and Å¿o pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, therefore hee found a fit time and a Å¿ecret place to conferre with him about that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e: and with Å¿mall perÅ¿waÅ¿ions, and by the offer of his daughter to the Dukes Å¿onne in mariage, with the gift of the whole Earldome of <hi>Hartford,</hi> whereunto the Duke pretended a rightfull title, but neuer could obtaine it from King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and by the diuiding and Å¿haring of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Kings treaÅ¿ure among themÅ¿elues, hee wonne him not only to conÅ¿ent vnto his villanie, but alÅ¿o to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him in that plot.</p>

The Lords (who were all free and abÅ¿olutely guiltleÅ¿Å¿e of any Å¿uch crime) Å¿ate Å¿till as men amazed, and not one of them Å¿pake a word. But at length the Lord <hi>HaÅ¿tings</hi> (who by reaÅ¿on of his great familiaritie with the Protector, imagined that hee was higheÅ¿t in his fauour) anÅ¿wered thus: My Lord, Å¿uch as haue Å¿o tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed the Law, deÅ¿erue the Å¿euereÅ¿t puniÅ¿hments which by the Law may be inflicted vpon them, and all the Lords aÅ¿Å¿ented thereunto.<note place="margin">A likely matter.</note> Then quoth the Protector, that SorcereÅ¿Å¿e (meaning the Queene) and that Strumpet <hi>Shores</hi> wife, haue conÅ¿pired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by witchcraft to depriue me of my life: and that you may be right well aÅ¿Å¿ured that it is true, behold (I pray you) and Å¿ee how their villanie hath alreadie Å¿eiÅ¿ed vpon my bodie.

And pleaÅ¿ing their vnaduiÅ¿ed paÅ¿Å¿ions with this fantaÅ¿ticall and vntruly grounded reÅ¿olution, they (by the prouokement and incitation of <hi>Michael IoÅ¿eph</hi> a Å¿turdie Blacke-Å¿mith, and of <hi>Thomas Flamocke,</hi> a man learned in the Law, yet factious, and of a tumultuous diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition) put themÅ¿elues in Armes, and determined to effect their purpoÅ¿e, though with violence, yea in the preÅ¿ence of the King.

                  <p>In this meane while the King perceiuing their intentions, and hauing recalled his Armie which was trauelling towards the North, handled this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e with Å¿uch policie, that hee would not Å¿uffer one man to moue one foot towards the WeÅ¿t, for theÅ¿e <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> eÅ¿peciall reaÅ¿ons.

                  <p>But Å¿o barren was that Countrie, and Å¿o poore and deÅ¿titute of all good things, and Å¿o vnÅ¿eaÅ¿onable was the weather there, which abounded with continuall Raine, Wind, Snow, Haile, Thunder, and Hideous Å¿tormes, and tempeÅ¿ts, that the Earle and the BiÅ¿hop returning brake vp their Armies, and themÅ¿elues went to <hi>Barwick,</hi> where they attended directions from the King.</p>

                  <p>With theÅ¿e, and with Å¿ome others he marched EaÅ¿twards, and came as farre as the Citie of <hi>Exeter,</hi> where hee vÅ¿ed manie perÅ¿ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iue and rethoricall arguments, and Å¿peeches, to incite the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, voluntarily to become his Å¿ubiects, and to Å¿urrender the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie into his hands.

And becauÅ¿e they wanted artillerie, and great Ordinance to make batteries vpon their walles: therefore (with Ladders, Crookes, Ropes, and other Engines,) they deÅ¿perately attempted to Å¿cale them in manie places, at one inÅ¿tant.
