            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthie Gentlemen (omitting all elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Eloquence, which oftentimes is vſed as a varniſh, to couer vnprofitable labours; As cunning Goldſmithes doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their baſeſt Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, when they Gilt it with their pureſt Gold) J purpoſe to render to you an accompt of two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which induced me to take this paine, and to publiſh this worke.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Jt is common among Phiſitions; That though profound Learning, and frequent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, haue furniſhed them with abundant skill, in their Honourable profeſsion: yet they doe ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:14635:3"/>
ſtriue to make their knowledge more perfect, in the diſcouerie of the imperfections of other mens bodies, then of their owne: Jn like ſort it is the common custome of our times; that many hopefull Gentlemen (whom Nature and Arts haue beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, with the rich treaſures of their bountie) do endeauour to be more exact and refined, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religion, Lawes, Gouernment, Maners, Strength, and Sites of forraine Countries, then of that Kingdome wherein themſelues were borne.</p>
                  <p>But as that man is wiſe in vaine, who is not wiſe vnto himſelfe; So it is a ſimple grace (nay to ſpeake plainly, it is a foule diſgrace) to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (eſpecially to ſuch a one, as hath, or doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpend much time abroad to know the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of forraine Nations) to be ignorant in the State of his owne Countrie at home. The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of which, affordeth as much varietie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable inſtruction, to captiuate the Readers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the peruſall, as the faireſt Pictures doe contentment, when with their artificiall beauties, they doe allure mens eyes to looke and to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                  <p>To this end therefore, that hencefoorth ſuch worthy Gentlemen as are purpoſed, in long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling, to enlarge their experience, by the view of
<pb facs="tcp:14635:3"/>
foraine Countries, may first be furniſhed with a conuenient knowledge of their owne; J vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke this labour, and doe preſent it vnto you, with this my firſt reaſon which induced me thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond reaſon of my ſo doing, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of mine owne conceit; which (as J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture) deceiues me not. For, in regard that the Hiſtories of this Kingdome, are frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, yea blemiſhed, by too too many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening Occurrences, and by a multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant Obſeruations (which doe much differ from the true Method, and Nature, of a well digeſted and compoſed Chronicle; and thereby doe extend it into a needleſſe and an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length) J am reſolued that the Readers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie (to obſerue and to remember) is much weakned thereby: And that many yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who doe egerly ſtriue to attaine to much knowledge in a ſhort time, doe rather bend their Studies and their courſes, to reade ouer the more narrowly contracted Hiſtories of other Countries, then the voluminous Diſcourſes of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to inlighten their knowledge much, by reading this little; J haue thruſt forth into the World this ſhort Hiſtorie, of the Raignes, Deeds, and Actions, of twentie of our Engliſh Kings; which J will neither praiſe, least J
<pb facs="tcp:14635:4"/>
wrong it by mine owne commendation; nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe, leaſt you (beleeuing mee on my word) ſhould thinke your time ill ſpent, to read what I haue written.</p>
                  <p>J know that ſuch as are worthily deſcended, or who by learning are made worthy, will not only winke at ſome imperfections, becauſe ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be gained by the reſt: but will alſo take in good part the preſentment of a ſmall gift; if it be deliuered with a friendly hand. To ſuch only, and to none other (which are you) doe J dedicate theſe my labors: Being confidently aſſured, that they cannot want their expected reward, which is nothing, but your kinde acceptance, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> (who was the ſonne of <hi>Egeldredus,</hi> and of <hi>Goditha</hi> his wife) <hi>Harold</hi> her brother, and ſecond ſonne to the Earle <hi>Godwin,</hi> vſurped this kingdom, and cauſed himſelfe to be crowned King, the Crowne being formerly giuen by King <hi>Edward</hi> vnto <hi>William</hi> the ſeuenth Duke of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and baſe ſonne to <hi>Robert</hi> their ſixt Duke. To whoſe vſe and behoofe, <hi>Harold</hi> had formerly ſworne to keepe the ſame. Whereof, when Duke <hi>William</hi> was certainely enformed, Hee charged him (by his Letters, and by Meſſengers) with his promiſe, confirmed by his Oath; and required him (in friendly ſort, and without blowes) to poſſeſſe him of his Crowne. But proud Ambition (arming him with a Reſolution to remaine a King in deſpight of threats, or Fortune) made him, rather to quoine diſhonorable excuſes, then to giue ſatisfaction as hee had ſworne: And for anſwere, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, That promiſes, and vowes raſhly made, and by compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as his was) eſpecially for a Kingdome, wherevnto the State had giuen no free conſent, were not (at all) to bee regarded. And therefore (ſeeing the Dukes Rule and Dominions were as ample,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14635:16"/>
and as large elſewhere, as Nature and Art had enabled him to manage, and to command) he wiſhed him to bee contented with his owne, and not aduenture to claſpe more within his hand, then he was well able to hold faſt, Nor to couet that which hee ſhould not enioy.</p>
                  <p>As this anſwere bred Diſcontent: So rage began to reſolue on Armes. For the Duke (aſſiſted by his Martiall friends) leuied a ſtrong Armie; and furniſhed it with all abiliments and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Warre: with which (through the aſſiſtance of ſome natiue Nobles, who adhered to his part) hee ſafely landed in <hi>Suſſex:</hi> where (hauing prouidently ſheltred himſelfe, againſt all ſuddaine ſtormes) hee challenged <hi>Harold</hi> to a ſingle Combat; thereby to decide the ſtrife, without much bloud. But <hi>Harold</hi> entertained not the Challenge; but ſent him word, That to gaine, or keepe a Kingdome, it required more blowes then two could giue.<note place="margin">14. <hi>October.</hi> 1066.</note> So that (within fewe dayes after) a fierce and cruell Battaile (of the continuance of one whole day) without intermiſſion, or breathing, was fought betwixt them. But in the Euening, HAROLD, being deadly wounded with an Arrow, left both his Kingdome and his life: And Duke <hi>William</hi> (almoſt with equall loſſe of his men) became Victor in the field.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Saxons</hi> Raigne ended</note>And thus ended the <hi>Saxons</hi> Raigne; which (from the firſt yeare of <hi>Hengistus,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord God foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeuentie and fiue, vntill the time of this Conqueſt in the yeare of our Lord God one thouſand ſixtie and ſixe) had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: (Sauing that now and then, it was interrupted by the <hi>Danes</hi>) the ſpace of fiue hundred foureſcore and eleuen yeares. The Duke (hauing thus ſlaine <hi>Harold,</hi> and gained his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) began to raigne as King: And (on Chriſtmas day then next following) hee was crowned by <hi>Aldredus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> by the enforced conſents of the Engliſh Nobles: Who (with an outward applauſe, but with an inward griefe and ſorrow) ſubmitted themſelues to be his ſubiects; the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. By whom (is hee trauailed to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Douer</hi>) he was preuented in his iourney, and compaſſed round about by valiant men of War, who (carying greene boughs in their hands, and reſembling a moouing Wood) enuironed the King, and all his followers, ere they were aware therof; And prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted manfully to die, rather then they would (by ſeruile baſeneſſe) be depriued of thoſe ancient Lawes and Cuſtomes, whereby their Countrie was then ruled. The King (perceiuing his owne danger,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14635:16"/>
and their reſolution) hearkned to their demaunds; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted their requeſts, but (for their bold and valorous attempt) hee honoured them with this preheminence; That euer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> inhabitants ſhould make the Vantgard of the Field.</p>
                  <p>This gained hee that Countrie,<note place="margin">The Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Policies.</note> and became ſole Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne of each whole Kingdome: and ruled it as a Conqueror, with more Policie than by profitable Lawes; and with more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie than did become the Gracious diſpoſition of a fauourable King.</p>
                  <p>For firſt of all (becauſe he preſumed, that ſuch as were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> did rather feare than loue, and would no longer obey, than the yoake lay heauie ouer their neckes) by receiuing Hoſtages of the beſt and deareſt eſteeme, hee ſecured the fidelities of ſuch as were either honourable, or potent, and ſent them into <hi>Normandie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuddaine force and ſtrength ſhould not depriue him of ſo ſure a meane of his ſafetie.</p>
                  <p>Then (to depriue the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all commaund, and to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them feeble, and his <hi>Normans</hi> ſtrong) he ſeized their chiefeſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both of Honour, and of Profit, into his owne hands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them vpon ſtrangers: Whereat the Engliſh grieued much, but found no remedie: for Weakeneſſe was enforced to yeeld to Power, and vſurping Policie tyrannized ouer the Oppreſſed, and bereaued them of their Right.</p>
                  <p>And (becauſe in thoſe daies the Clergie was had in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> among the people; in regard, that their authoritie was not confined within the bounds of their Spirituall Iuriſdictions) hee reſolued to clip their wings, becauſe they ſhould no longer ſoare ſo high; and did ordaine, That from thenceforth they ſhould not commaund with anie Temporall Authoritie whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>He was not ignorant, that the hope of Libertie did oftentimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> incite ſuch as vnwillingly were made ſeruile, to watch for oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to procure their Freedome: and therefore (to preuent ſuch dangers as might otherwiſe enſue) he vtterly diſarmed and diſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned all the Natiues of the Land, turning their Hopes into Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire; and preuenting their Expectations for Releaſement, with the preſent Extremitie of their Bondage. Thus weakened he ſuch as were truly valiant, and thus made he them to ſuffer much who (if they had beene at libertie) would haue beene able to repell great force.</p>
                  <p>And (becauſe the concourſe of much people might giue them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſome occaſion, both to conferre of the eſtate which they were in,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14635:17"/>
and alſo to conſult of the meanes of their deliuerance from their Thraldome) he debarred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from frequent and common meetings, eſpecially in the night: which to preuent, he cauſed a Bell in euerie Village, Towne, and Citie, to be rong at eight of the clocke in the euening; vpon the ſound whereof, all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men were enjoyned to couer their fire, and to keepe themſelues within their dores. And this ceremonie was, and is yet called, <hi>Couer le fiew,</hi> or the raking vp of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> To diminiſh the Nobilitie, he vſed to tranſport them for his Warres beyond the Seas: and if they returned backe againe, then might they well perceiue, that he rather meant their deſtruction, than regarded their ſeruice: for no reward was giuen to them, though they were valiant, nor anie ſhew at all was made, that their forwardneſſe was accepted by the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And thus dealt he likewiſe with the vulgar ſort; by whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he fought his ſharpeſt battailes in <hi>Normandie</hi> and in <hi>France:</hi> thereby leſſening their numbers, and making his owne power more eminent among ſuch, as he enforced to lament their owne misfortunes, and in vaine to meditate vpon their preſent woe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> He alſo erected ſtrong Forts and Caſtles in ſundrie places of this Realme, which were commaunded by his followers; whoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe was ſuch againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as that they dared not to make ſhew, that they repined at any thing, which wickedly they did amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> As long as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> abounded in Riches, and in Wealth, he knew they were not altogether heartleſſe; and therefore he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them of thoſe comforts. And (to encreaſe his owne ſtore) he practiſed ſubtile trickes on both eſtates: for he robbed the Clergie of all their beſt and richeſt Plate and Ornaments (which had been conſecrated to holy vſes) alledging, That Theeues and Traiterous Rebels had hid them there, to deceiue him of his forfeitures, and ſecretly to ſupport themſelues therewith, to his great hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> He alſo enacted and eſtabliſhed ſtrait and ſeuere Lawes, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed them in his owne Language; by meanes whereof, manie (who were of great eſtate, and of much worth) through ignorance did tranſgreſſe, and their ſmalleſt offences were great enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title the Conquerour to the Lands and Riches which they did poſſeſſe. All which he ſeized on, and tooke from them, without remorſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Then he diſallowed the Patents, and the Graunts of former Kings, and publiſhed them to be meerely void; and hauing ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred them into his owne hands, he ſold them againe to the true
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14635:17"/>
owners for great ſummes of money, if they could pay them: but otherwiſe he gaue them to his <hi>Normans,</hi> and to the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He procured a generall view to be taken of his ſubiects Lands,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and cauſed them to be juſtly meaſured, and their cattell to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and thereby he taxed them, according to ſuch proportions as he pleaſed; and (by ſuch vndue Exactions) he ſcraped and ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched together the Treaſure of this Realme, little regarding the wants and pouertie of his conquered people, if (by anie meanes) he could augment his owne ſtore.</p>
                  <p>He erected ſundrie Courts for the adminiſtration of his new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Lawes, and of Iuſtice; and leaſt his Iudges ſhould beare too great a ſway, by reaſon of his abſence, he cauſed them all to follow his Court vpon all remoues: Whereby he not onely curbed their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which incited them to be great, but alſo tyred out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation with extraordinarie troubles, and exceſſiue charges in the proſecution of their Suites in Law.</p>
                  <p>To open a wide dore, and to giue the more free acceſſe vnto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> 
                     <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> (if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould happen to rebell) he rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated all Churches, Chappels, Villages, and Townes, which ſtood within the compaſſe of manie myles in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and made the New Foreſt there; vtterly diſpeopling thoſe places where God was formerly ſerued, and frugall Husbandrie maintained; making them an habitation for wilde and ſauage Beaſts: which act and deede he coloured with the pretence of fitneſſe, and conueniencie for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in Hunting, when great affaires and important buſineſſe would giue him leaue. But God reuenged his owne cauſe by the vntimely death of <hi>Rufus</hi> his ſonne, and ſucceſſor; who (as he hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) was ſlaine with an arrow in the ſame Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all other pleaſures he placed his chiefeſt delight in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and for the furtherance thereof, when he had ſeized into his owne hands all the Chaſes and Foreſts of this Kingdome, then (to preſerue his Game from diſturbance, and from ſpoile) he made and executed moſt ſharpe and bitter Lawes againſt ſuch, as (vnlicenced) preſumed to hunt in them; as the loſſe of eyes, limbes, and ſuch like: But they were afterwards made more milde and gentle, by ſuch as by ſucceſſion wore his Crowne.</p>
                  <p>He gaue large territories and ſpatious fields vnto his fauorites; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> who did diuide them into Farmes, for their particular vſes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and the reſidue of them they graunted or leaſed to their ſlaues and ſeruants; thereby creating Manors, and entitling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the Lords of them. The King alſo vpon thoſe his gifts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned thoſe grounds, diuiding them into Hydes of Land, euery
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14635:18"/>
Hyde containing twentie acres, and eight Hydes making a whole Knights fee. The Tenures which he reſerued, were Knights ſeruice <hi>in capite:</hi> by meanes whereof, his Tenants were enioyned to doe him manie neceſſarie and honorable Seruices, either in his Warres, or to his Royall perſon. For the performance whereof, he tooke their Oathes in publike Courts, both of Homage and of Fealtie. And by reaſon of this kinde of Tenure, he diſpoſed of the bodies of their Heires in marriage as he liſted, and retayned in his cuſtodie and Wardſhip, to his owne vſe, their whole Inheritance, vntill they accompliſhed their age of one and twentie yeares. Which Tenures are continued at this day. And, by his example, others of great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions did the like.</p>
                  <p>And thus may we plainely ſee (as in a Mappe) the perfect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and Deſcription of his rigorous and ſharpe Gouernement; wherein he rather practiſed the licentious power of an inſolent Conqueror, than the gratious kindneſſe of an annointed King. By meanes whereof, many feared, few did loue him: and ſuch as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him beſt, were many times in great hazard (vpon ſmall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to be frowned on.</p>

                  <p>As on the Sea-ſhore one waue ſucceedes another: ſo in humane affaires there is no end of troubles. No ſooner was this buſineſſe concluded, but another did begin.

So this vnexpected reſiſtance compelled the King to caſt his plot into a new mould, and by ſleight and policie to effect that, which by open violence he could not doe. Wherefore (not making himſelfe ouer-much beholding to long deliberation) he ſent many of his chiefeſt Commanders into <hi>England;</hi> who (with more than ordinarie diligence and ſpeede) in ſhort time waged a ſtrong Armie of twentie thouſand men: who (being readie to be embarked) were vnexpectedly greeted with this faire offer,<note place="margin">A politike and a pleaſing Taxe.</note> That ſuch of them as would ſeuerally giue tenne ſhillings to the King, towards his leuying of new forces in <hi>Normandie,</hi> ſhould be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from that journey. This demaund (in regard of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar giuer) was not great: but the entire value thereof, when it was collected, amounted to a good ſumme; becauſe there were few, or none, who by this payment procured not their diſcharge.

For he no ſooner ſaw his reuolted ſubjects of the North,<note place="margin">The Rebels ſubdued.</note> but he loaded them in ſuch ſort with blowes and wounds, that ſuch as fled not he made a prey vnto death, or made them miſerable examples to their friends; who might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane them, but could not releaſe them, of their loſſe of Eares, Eyes, Hands, Noſes, or Feete.

                  <p>Then did the King (with new ſtrength) march againe into <hi>Wales:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King feared the greatneſſe of <hi>Englands</hi> ſtrength, and the proſperitie of this Kingdome was hurtfull vnto his eyes:<note place="margin">The French king taketh part with Arthur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King Iohn.</note> and glad he was, if (at anie time) the leaſt occaſion would offer him ſome ſeruice to further his deſignes againſt King <hi>Iohn.</hi> For proofe hereof, he proteſted a world of loue to the ſaid <hi>Arthur;</hi> informed him of his Title to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and of his vndoubted right to the Duchies of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and of <hi>Britaine;</hi> animated him to rayſe his ſpirits, and to aduance his courage to winne them all. If he were deſtitute of Friends, which might aduiſe and counſell him; he and his Nobles would ſupplie that want: if he ſtood in need of Siluer and of Gold, to feede and to nouriſh the great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of that Warre; he ſhould be ſupplyed with ſufficient ſtore:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14635:41"/>
And if he would haue valiant men to fight for him, and for thoſe his Rights, hee would ſupplie him with manie thouſands, who ſhould aduenture to ſpend their beſt bloud in his Quarrels.</p>
                  <p>Theſe large and friendly proffers (which indeede proceeded rather from a jealouſie which the <hi>French</hi> King had of himſelfe, by reaſon of King <hi>Iohns</hi> Greatneſſe, than from anie inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or heartie loue which hee bare vnto <hi>Arthur,</hi> the lawfull and the rightfull Heire of this Crowne) and the longing deſire which made this young Gallant hopefull of thoſe great atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; perſuaded him verie eaſily, not onely to accept of the <hi>French</hi> Kings friendſhip, but alſo to vſe his aide. So that partly by the helpe of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and partly by the <hi>French</hi> Kings meanes,<note place="margin">Arthur Plantagenet leuieth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> hee leuied a puiſſant Armie; and wonne diuers places both of Worth and of Strength in <hi>Normandie.</hi> But the Kings Lieutenant, and his other Agents in that Duchie, defended themſelues valiantly, perſiſted in their Duties, and fought it out diuers times;<note place="margin">King Iohn goeth into Normandie with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> vntill King <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe came into that Countrey with a ſtrong Armie, and fought manie cruell Battailes with his Nephew.</p>
                  <p>But oftentimes it falleth out, that by Warre (which is the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Peace) Peace it ſelfe is procured. For when thoſe two Princes had exchanged ſtore of blowes, and when their Armies had made hauocke each of other; and death had drenched her ſelfe in their bloud: they entred into certaine Capitulations for Peace;<note place="margin">A peace is concluded.</note> which, for a ſhort time, gaue them ſome reſpit of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

And hereupon the <hi>French</hi> King carried a faire Armie into <hi>Normandie;</hi> with which hee ſpoyled, ranſacked, and depopulated manie places in that Duchie.</p>
                  <p>But King <hi>Iohn</hi> (who wanted nothing but money to encounter with ſo peruerſe an enemie) was warned by his Lords, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the inferiour ſort of his common people, That ſhame would wait vpon him for his neglect, in ſuffering his Honour to be trampled on, and his Territories in ſuch ſort, without blowes, to be taken from him.

But becauſe his helpe then failed, and the King could not (at that time) obtaine his purpoſe: Hee reſolued to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it at a more ſolemne meeting. For which cauſe principally, He ſummoned his High Court of Parliament: but the ſaid three Lords (vpon good information being jealous of ſuch vnkindly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) repaired to the ſaid aſſembly; being ſtrongly garded by a multitude of valiant men at armes: by meanes whereof they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their own libertie; and the vngodly project of the King, and of his wicked Counſellors, came to nought.</p>

For in <hi>France</hi> freſh ſupplies were hourely prouided to reuiue the former warre,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1445"/> and euery day offered euident demonſtrations, that nothing was more to be expected then blowes. Wherefore to encounter thoſe preparations with the like prouiſions, the King aſſembled his high Court of Parlament:<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks oration. His motion.</note> in which the Marques of <hi>Suffolke</hi> (in a powerfull, glozing, and tedious Oration) extolled his owne deſerts aboue the skies, as well in his ſeruice in the <hi>French</hi> warres, as alſo in mouing and in concluding the late truce, and the Kings mariage. He alſo admoniſhed his Highneſſe, and the two houſes there aſſembled, what preparations for warre were made in <hi>France,</hi> and how behoouefull it was for the King to doe the like. And vpon this motion (proceeding from his haughtie pride and ambitious minde) the whole aſſemblie became humble ſuters to his Maieſtie,<note place="margin">A Record made of his acts.</note> that not only his ſaid admonition and aduice, but alſo all his ſaid former ſeruices and doings, might in moſt ample ſort be regiſtred among the Rolles of Parliament, for the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allizing of his honour and of his name: which with wonderfull applauſe was conſented vnto; and ſhortly after he was created Duke of <hi>Suffolke.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is made a Duke.</note> Yet for all this, before many yeares were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he was in the ſame place accuſed, conuicted, and condemned for ſundrie treaſons,<note place="margin">Humana ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duca.</note> miſpriſions, and offences; for which he was exiled, taken, and without law put to death, as hereafter wee ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>Such is the continuall vncertaintie, and the aſſured inſtabilitie of worldly glorie, and the vanitie thereof; that when men doe imagine, that they doe ſecurely ſleepe on the bed of honour, then is their reſt moſt diſeaſefull, and their ſoundeſt ſleepe is but an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſlumber, troubled with fearefull and ſtrange dreames; rather informing them of approching dangers, then aſſertaining them of the long continuance of that ſuppoſed felicitie, which ſo vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably they doe deſire.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> It will be worthie of our labour, in this place to obſerue, that from henceforth the affaires of <hi>France</hi> proceeded worſe &amp; worſe: ſo that within few yeares that whole kingdome,<note place="margin">The cauſes of the loſſe of France, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, and Aquitaine.</note> with the Duchies of <hi>Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> were vtterly loſt. The cauſes of which misfortunes are principally noted to be theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt was, the releaſement of <hi>Lewys</hi> the noble Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> for his ranſome. For his wiſdome inſtructed the weake
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14635:134"/>
Counſell of <hi>France.</hi> His perſwaſions reconciled all ſuch iarres as were too too common among the Nobilitie of <hi>France:</hi> and his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was put into execution with ſuch excellencie of diſcretion, that by his example the <hi>French</hi> cowards became valiant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond was this vnhappie and this vnfortunate mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betwixt the King and his Queene: for by meanes thereof the Earle of <hi>Arminake,</hi> his kinſmen, and his friends, became mortall enemies to the Engliſh Nation, hating them for their Kings ſake, becauſe he had vnfaithfully forſaken his affied wife. And beſides that, the King had not one penny with the Queene for her mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age portion; but ſpent on her many thouſand pounds before hee enioyed her as his wife. And by this match alſo the King did not ſtrengthen himſelfe with any new friends: for her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers penurie and wants enforced him to liue almoſt as a priuate man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the releaſement of King <hi>Henries</hi> right to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Angeow,</hi> and to the Country of <hi>Mayne,</hi> which bordered vpon <hi>Normandie,</hi> ſo weakned the Kings Army in that Prouince, that ſhortly after he was driuen out and expulſed from that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, and all <hi>Aquitaine</hi> by reaſon thereof was quite loſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth was the guiltleſſe death and murder of the moſt noble and good Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whoſe aduice and counſell were the ſinewes of thoſe warres.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To theſe alſo may bee added the diuers diſpoſitions and qualities of the King and of the Queene.<note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King Henry.</note> For King <hi>Henry</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding milde, courteous, and gentle, patient in all aduerſities, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in proſperitie, a deſpiſer of couetouſneſſe, an hater of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, a louer of quietneſſe and of peace. Hee loathed warres, and the toile and troubles of the world: hee ſpent much time in his priuate ſtudies, and in his religious exerciſes vnto God. Hee was not deſirous to meddle much with publike affaires, nor with the gouernment of his kingdome. He deſired not to reuenge any wrong which was done vnto him. He was more mercifull to ſuch as tranſgreſſed, then willing to extend the rigour of iuſtice againſt ſuch as had offended his lawes: yea, ſo little reſpectfull was hee of his owne greatneſſe, and of his knightly dignitie and honour, (in regard of his ſoules health) that hee loued rather to be ruled then to gouerne as a King.</p>
                  <p>But the young Queene (who was faire and beautifull,<note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Queen Margaret.</note> ſtrong and luſtie, proud and haughtie, ſtout and reuengefull, craftie and politicke) was not well pleaſed with the ſoft nature and flexible diſpoſition of the King: neither could her ambitious ſpirit endure,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14635:135"/>
that he being more then of full yeares, ſhould (as a pupill) be ruled and directed by another man. Being therefore clearely reſolued to diſmiſſe the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> of his Protectorſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,<note place="margin">The Queene diſmiſſeth the Protector of his office and charge.</note> and making a publike ſhew of her inward intention to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie his place, ſhee was encouraged and furthered therein by her truſtie friends the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> who (by the ſecret inſtigation of the rich Cardinall of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who mortally hated the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) not only remoued him from his place, but called him to a ſtrict account for the expence of the treaſure of this kingdome: which iuſtly and honeſtly was disburſed by him, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and furthering of the <hi>French</hi> warres.</p>
                  <p>And when they perceiued that they were vnable by that courſe and practiſe to attaine vnto their purpoſe, they procured the Queene (in the Kings name) to aſſemble his high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Burye,</hi> where the ſaid Duke (ſurnamed for his ſurpaſſing and heroicall vertues,<note place="margin">He is called the good Duke of Gloceſter.

Aſſoone as he was thus diſpatched out of the way, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> ſecretly conſpired with his great allies and truſtie friends, to ſet on foot his title to the Crowne. And likewiſe the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> (who with the Queene ruled all the roſt) reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted more his owne profit, then the benefit of the common-weale, and vſed ſundrie deuiſes and cunning practiſes to oppreſſe the people,<note place="margin">The French warres are neglected.</note> that with their coine he might fill vp his owne purſe. By meanes whereof, no prouiſion of money was made for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of the Kings warres in <hi>France;</hi> no Armie was newly raiſed to aſſiſt ſuch as were then abroad;<note place="margin">A weake Counſell.</note> no wages were paid to ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or vnto Captaines: which made them diſcontentedly to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure.

                  <p>Thus was the Truce violated on both Parts: And thus were thoſe bloudie warres renewed, which were daily fed with the ſlaughters of the braueſt, and of the moſt valiant men.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1483"/> the late deceaſed King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, <note place="margin">Edward the Fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> wee may thereon make this pretie abbreuiate and ſhort collection: That hee was of a goodly perſonage, and of a kingly preſence: That he was very ſtrong, and paſſing valiant, not proud in proſperitie, nor deiected with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe fortune: That hee was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately pleaſant and merie: That he was pleaſing to his Nobles, familiar with his ſouldiers, and amiable to his inferiour ſubiects: That he was mercifull to offenders, and fauoured all ſuch as did well: That he was very wiſe, diſcreet, prouident, and ſoundly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed in all his actions. Yet was he ſomewhat too credulous, and too wanton, and in his latter daies more couetous then formerly he had beene.</p>
                  <p>By many worthy endeuours he expreſſed how much hee lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for his peoples loue:<note place="margin">His affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> and by one action hee more particularly declared it, then by all the reſt. For in the next Summer before he died, hee required the Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> and his brethren to repaire to his Caſtle of <hi>Windſour,</hi> where hee then lay. And when they expected ſome extraordinarie imploiment in State affaires,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14635:164"/>
becauſe ſo many of them were called thither, not troubling them with any buſineſſe, either great or ſmall, priuate or publike, nor requiring of them any ſupplies from their plentie, hee royally fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, banqueted, and entertained them, not only with the choiſeſt, beſt, and moſt coſtly delicates that could bee gotten, but alſo hee gladded them vnſpeakably with his owne preſence and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-like behauiour. Hee afterwards carried them into his Parke, where the thicke fall of fat Deere (beſides many other things) gaue them warrant of their kinde welcome. And at their departing from him, he ſent ſuch great ſtore of veniſon into the Citie, for the friendly feaſting of their neighbours there, that nothing euer won him more heartie loue among his ſubiects of that place.</p>
                  <p>He left behinde him two ſonnes; <hi>Edward,</hi> who being of the age of thirteene yeares, vnfortunately ſucceeded him in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who was two yeares younger; and fiue daughters, namely <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who afterwards maried King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, and was mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Cicilie, Bridget,</hi> and <hi>Katherine,</hi> whoſe fortunes ſeldome laughed, and <hi>Anne,</hi> who maried <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Haward,</hi> who after was created Earle of <hi>Surrey.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Richard Duke of Gloceſter deſcribed.</note>The ſaid noble King (when he died) left behinde him but one brother, namely <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was (by common report) a monſter in nature. For he had many teeth when he was borne. He was exceedingly deformed in the compoſure of his bodie: for of ſtature he was but low, crooke-backed; his left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was much higher then the other: his viſage was vncomely, his complexion ſwart and browne: he was exceeding ſtrong, yet much withered in his left arme: he was violent, fierce, and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily cruell; a good ſouldier, diſcreet to order well, and politicke to rule. Hee was very haſtie and forward in great expeditions and weightie actions; yet wiſe, and well aduiſed before hee would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to fight. He was ambitious beyond meaſure, and his deſires for ſoueraigntie had no bounds. What he contriued, were it good or bad, hee would by one meanes or by another aſſuredly effect it. Hee made his conſcience in all things to ſerue his will, though his will could not bee obtained without the effuſion of guiltleſſe bloud. He would oftentimes make himſelfe poore by his lauiſh bountie to ſuch as wickedly ſerued his turne: and would againe quickly enrich himſelfe by pilling and by polling of ciuill and of honeſt men. Hee was ſo cunning a diſſembler, that hee would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie moſt familiarly and ieſt pleaſantly with ſuch as hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly hated in his heart. Hee ſpared no mans death, whoſe life
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14635:164"/>
reſiſted his vngodly purpoſes; nor puniſhed any man for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if his wickedneſſe might be applied to his ſeruice. This am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, this fierce, and this cruell man, in his brother King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> daies (as wiſe men did coniecture) directed his aime to make himſelfe a King.<note place="margin">10. E. 4.</note> For he with others murdered Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the eldeſt ſonne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth:<note place="margin">10. E. 4.</note> and with his owne hand hee ſlew the ſame King when he was a priſoner in the Tower; and was conſenting (as the world blabbed) to the death and deſtruction of his elder brother, <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> in the ſame place.<note place="margin">10. E. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edwards</hi> death, and the minoritie of his two ſonnes,<note place="margin">Richard ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Crowne.</note> gaue him fit opportunitie to worke miſchiefe, which firſt of all he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to proſecute by the reuiuing of olde grudges betwixt the Queenes kindred and the Kings, although the laſt King in his death-bed had reconciled them, and made them all friends. For he knew, that where malice and hatred are of counſell, there no good action or ſound concluſion can be expected. And by this practiſe he endeuoured firſt to make him ſelfe equall with the beſt, and then to be the beſt of all.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt alſo now obſerue, that at the time of King <hi>Edwards</hi> death the young Prince in his owne perſon kept his reſidence and Court at <hi>Ludlow</hi> in the dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> that by his preſence he might reſtraine the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> from ſuch outragious enterpriſes as oftentimes their licentious and bad manners incited them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And the protection of his perſon was by the laſt King appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Anthonie</hi> Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> the Queenes brother, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide Vncle to the ſaid Prince. And her allies and her kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes did now poſſeſſe all roomes and offices of honour and of profit about him, hee being King: which the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> much maligned, and ſo ſcorned it, that in his conceits he contriued how he might thruſt them all out of thoſe places. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hee oftentimes ſecretly and ſeriouſly conferred with <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who was Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine to the laſt King. To them hee diſcouered the meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Queene, and of her kinsfolkes in reſpect of theirs, and told them plainly, that if thoſe Vpſtarts remained ſo neere vnto the King in his youth, they would (through his fauour) be ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull when he came to his full age, that all their honours, their poſſeſſions, and their liues, would be in danger to be made ſubiect to their willes. And therefore he aduiſed them to ioine with him for their remoue, and to diuide and ſhare betwixt themſelues all ſuch benefits as by thoſe meanes ſhould be atchieued.</p>
                  <p>Theſe faire perſwaſions, and their owne ambitious humours,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14635:165"/>
quickly wrought the ſaid two great Lords,<note place="margin">His practiſe againſt the Queenes kindred.</note> not onely to hearken willingly to this diſcourſe, but alſo to bee confederates with the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> in that practiſe, which quickly was attempted in this manner.</p>
                  <p>The Queene with the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> her brother, and with her ſonne <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and with her other friends, being guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a ſtrong power of armed men and ſouldiers, intended to bring the young King from <hi>Wales</hi> towards <hi>London</hi> to be crowned. And the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> knowing that if his feat were not wrought before that time, it could not eaſily be effected after; and conſidering likewiſe, that if he with his confederates ſhould come armed againſt the King to meet him, and by open violence attempt to get the Kings perſon into their poſſeſſion, their ſaid enterpriſe would be cenſured and adiudged to be a rebellious action, and no leſſe then Treaſon. Wherefore he cunningly directed and ſent his letters to the Queene, and called to her remembrance the heartie loue and friendſhip which the late King her deceaſed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his death-bed had ratified and confirmed betwixt the Lords of his owne bloud and alliance, and the kinsfolkes of the Queene. He likewiſe informed her, that it was commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that her brother and her friends which were neere about the Kings perſon, intended with a ſtrong power and with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men to conduct his Maieſtie (for his Coronation) from <hi>Wales</hi> to the Citie of <hi>London.</hi> He proteſted and ſwore vnto her, that his humble dutie to his Soueraigne, and his vnfained loue to her and to her kinsfolkes and children, incited him ſeriouſly and earneſtly to aduiſe and counſell her and them, to diſmiſſe thoſe companies of armed men, for that he feared much leſt the gathering of them together would be the occaſion of new broiles, and of ciuill wars. For ſeeing (quoth he) that many former battailes triumphing in bloud, haue now made peace, and ſeeing that the ſtate of the whole Kingdome hateth Armes, and ſeeing that the King hath no Competitor for his Crowne, and that loue and friendſhip hath vnited and knit together the mindes and the hearts of all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſeeing that perfect tranquillitie and a ſecure reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath quieted and gladded all the people, certainly the Kings comming towards the Citie of <hi>London</hi> with an armed traine, will make the Lords of the deceaſed Kings bloud, and many others, exceeding iealous of their intention, and to be fearfull leſt ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret plot be cunningly contriued to ſurpriſe them, when in dutie and for ſeruice they ſhall make their acceſſe vnto the King; and that ſuch feare and iealouſie will occaſion them (for their defence
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14635:165"/>
and ſafetie) to raiſe the like forces, whereof might enſue much danger, diſcontentment, and perhaps blowes.</p>
                  <p>The Queene and her friends (who meant none ill) taking much comfort in this aduice,<note place="margin">The Kings ſtrength is ſent away.</note> becauſe ſhe ſuppoſed it ſprang from heartie loue, and alſo becauſe the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> had at the ſame time with all reſpectiue dutie and reuerence likewiſe written vnto the King, and louingly to the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> her brother, and vnto <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> her ſonne, cauſed all ſuch ſtrength of armed men as was prouided for the Kings conduction towards <hi>London,</hi> to bee diſmiſſed and ſent away. And the ſaid Earle, and Lord, and ſome others of their friends, brought the King forth in his iourney to the Citie of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Stony Stratford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten miles from thence. And becauſe that little Towne was not capable of the whole traine, the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> and his priuate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers remained that night in <hi>Northampton.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queens kindred is betraied.</note> But on the ſudden and vnlooked for, the Dukes of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (being ſtrongly accompanied with great ſtore of reſolute attendants) diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mounted themſelues in the Earles Inne, and with all complements of loue and friendſhip they paſſed the time with him; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their extraordinarie familiaritie, he ſecured himſelfe of their heartie and vnfained loue. But aſſoone as their companies were in their beds, the two Dukes ſeiſed vpon all the keies of the ſame Inne, and cauſed all the waies betwixt thoſe two Townes ſo to be watched and warded, that no perſon (of what degree or qualitie ſoeuer he were) could haue any paſſage there. And they reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, that the pretence of their ſo doing was becauſe no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them ſhould in the morning preuent them for diligence to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon the King. Whereof when the Earle <hi>Ryuers</hi> had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, neceſſitie compelled him to diſſemble, and to ſeeme as if he ſuſpected none euill, although he knew that by the Dukes policie and craftie cunning he was ouertaken and beguiled. Yet in friendly and in a iocund manner he came vnto the two Dukes, and asked them why they had ſo done. But ſuddenly they entred into a needleſſe and cauſeleſſe quarrell with the ſaid Earle,<note place="margin">They are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</note> ſurpriſed his perſon, and committed him to ſafe keeping. And then in good and quiet manner the two Dukes rode to <hi>Stony Stratford,</hi> and humbly preſented their duties and their ſeruice to the King, who being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of that which ſo newly had hapned, receiued them with a cheerfull countenance and with much ioy. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they alſo ſeiſed vpon <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> the Kings halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brother, and vpon Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> and ſome others, all which they ſent (vnder a ſtrong Guard) to the Caſtle of <hi>Pomfret</hi> in the

                     <note place="margin">The Kings ſeruants are remoued.</note>The two Dukes alſo and the Lord Chamberlaine remoued from the King all his other Officers, and moſt of his meniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, informing all men which attended the King, or expected the ſequell of this buſineſſe, that the ſaid Earle, Lord, and Knight, with ſome others, had reſolued to deſtroy all the Lords of King <hi>Edwards</hi> bloud, and to rule both the King and Common-weale ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne will.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Queene with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren take Sanctuarie.</note>When the Queene (who at that time lay, with the Kings bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the young Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and with her fiue daughters, at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) heard of theſe tumults, and what had hapned to her brother, ſonne, and friends, it repented her much that ſhe had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed them (vpon the Duke of <hi>Gloceſters</hi> cunning letters) to diſmiſſe and to diſcharge their ſouldiers and men of warre. And becauſe ſhe had good cauſe to feare the euent thereof, ſhee with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren entred into the Sanctuarie there. The young King alſo mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned grecuouſly to ſee the wofull tragedie wherein his friends miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes were ſo vnexpectedly acted. But the two Dukes recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him with the expreſſion of their humble duties and ſeruice, and with a thouſand proteſtations of their fidelitie and troth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Highneſſe during their liues:<note place="margin">The King is brought to London.</note> and then they brought him with great honour neere to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> where he was met by the Lord Maior, and fiue hundred graue Citizens more, in whoſe preſence the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> vſed ſuch humble dutie and reuerence to the King, and ſo diſcreetly demeaned himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that none of them ſuſpected that any thing was done but for the Kings preſeruation, and for his good: yea the Nobilitie and Counſellors of Eſtate were ſo inwardly perſwaded to reſt in the ſame beleefe, that (by their generall conſent) they forthwith made him the Protector both of the Kings royall perſon,<note place="margin">The Duke of Gloceſter is made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector.</note> and of his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>When the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> had procured and obtained this high place which his heart infinitely deſired, (the ſame being an office of greateſt honour,<note place="margin">He poſſeſſeth himſelfe of the Kings brother the Duke of Yorke.</note> of confidence, and of truſt) hee made no doubt but that his purpoſe would quickly (though wickedly) bee brought to paſſe as himſelfe wiſhed, if he could alſo get the young Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> into his hands. And to the end that his deſires might not remaine fruitleſſe, hee greeuouſly complained to the Kings Counſell of the froward obſtinacie of the Queene, who detained
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14635:166"/>
the ſaid young Duke diſhonourably in the Sanctuarie as an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in priſon, cauſing thereby the gouernment of the whole Kingdome, and the Nobles and officers thereof, to be exceedingly blamed and taxed, not only at home, but alſo in all other Chriſtian Prouinces and Kingdomes. He vrged alſo, that his Grand-maſter the young King was infinitely wronged and diſheartened, for that he was not permitted to enioy the ſocietie and the companie of his owne and only brother, whom aboue all other creatures in the world he reſpected and longed for.</p>
                  <p>The Lords hauing conſidered of the Dukes motion, reſolued that he had ſpoken well, and that it was fitting it ſhould be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto. And thereupon, they made eſpeciall choice of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> (vpon whoſe fidelitie and loue, the Queene did not a little relie) to goe to her, and to pray her (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further trouble) to ſend the yong Duke her Sonne to the king his brother: That he might be comforted with his ſight, and bee made merrie and iocund with his companie. And withall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to tell her, that for many reaſons the young Duke might not be detained there.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons why the young Duke ought not to be in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie.</note> becauſe the whole eſtate of this Kingdome would be ſlandered at home and among forraine Nations, if it ſhould permit ſo young a childe, by birth ſo noble, ſo neere vnto the King, and ſo innocent, to liue in priſon: (for euery Sanctuarie is a priſon.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, becauſe none could claime the benefit of ſuch a place, but he whoſe conſcience did accuſe him of ſome offence, for which he feared to be puniſhed by the law. But the conſcience of this young Duke cannot be ſo burdened, becauſe his infancie and his innocencie doe excuſe him of any ſuch fault, and therefore hee needed no protection there.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, that none might enioy the priuilege of a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, but ſuch a one as is enabled by true diſcretion to demand it. But the young Duke (by reaſon of his infancie) hath not ſufficient diſcretion to require it, and therefore hee is not capable of it, nor may enioy it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſt of all, hee was required to aſſure her, that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be taken out of a Sanctuarie, if it bee for his good and welfare, and not to his hurt, or to puniſh him: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Queene did obſtinately refuſe to deliuer him, it was reſolued and determined, that hee ſhould be taken from thence, and from her without her leaue; and the rather, for that great ſuſpition and feare was iuſtly conceiued, that her frowardneſſe or her iealouſie would perſwade her to ſend him beyond the Sea, as
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:14635:167"/>
if hee ſhould bee more ſafe there then in his brother the Kings Court.</p>
                  <p>When this round meſſage was done vnto the Queene, though it ſo nipped her at the heart, that willingly ſhe would not let him goe, alleadging that none but his owne mother was more fit to tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor him, or to attend him, hee being ſo young, ſickly, and very weake; and that each of thoſe two brethren was the others ſafetie ſo long as they were kept aſunder, and that the life of the one was maintained in the bodie of the other, and that if one of them did well, the other was in no perill or danger, and that nothing was more hazardous then to keepe them both in one place together: yet when ſhee perceiued which way the game went, and that it was reſolued by the Protector, and by his friends, that arguments ſhould not preuaile, ſhee embraced the louely young Duke in her armes, ſhe kiſſed him many times, ſhe wept bitterly, and praying Almightie God to preſerue and to defend him from all iniurie and dangers, ſhe deliuered him to the Arch-biſhop, telling him, that ſhee would require that poore and innocent childe at his hands. And thus vnwillingly and ſorrowfully ſhe did let him goe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A monſtrous diſſembler.</note>When the harmeleſſe infant was by the Arch biſhop deliuered into the Protectors hands, who with many other Lords attended the Queenes anſwere in the Starre-chamber, he tooke him (before the whole aſſemblie) in his armes, he hugged and embraced him, and kiſſed him once and twice, and againe and againe, proteſting vpon his ſoule, that no worldly thing (his Maieſtie only excepted) was ſo deare vnto him as that young childe, when as indeede hee meant nothing more then the deſtruction and ruine of them both. And hauing brought him to the King, who was infinitely ioied with his preſence and companie, hee conueied them (within few daies after) with princely pompe and attendance thorow the Citie of <hi>London</hi> to the Tower,<note place="margin">The King and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent to the Tower.</note> vnder the pretence of an eſpeciall care and prouidence that they ſhould in ſafetie remaine there vntill the Common-weales troubles were thorowly quieted and appeaſed, whereas in truth and in deede nothing was out of frame, nothing was ill ordered, but by himſelfe, and by ſome other great Lords who wholly applied themſelues to his will.</p>

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14635:167"/>
his priuitie and aſſiſtance, becauſe he was ſo mightie and ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, therefore hee found a fit time and a ſecret place to conferre with him about that buſineſſe: and with ſmall perſwaſions, and by the offer of his daughter to the Dukes ſonne in mariage, with the gift of the whole Earldome of <hi>Hartford,</hi> whereunto the Duke pretended a rightfull title, but neuer could obtaine it from King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and by the diuiding and ſharing of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Kings treaſure among themſelues, hee wonne him not only to conſent vnto his villanie, but alſo to aſſiſt him in that plot.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (whom the Protector for old acquaintance,<note place="margin">The Lord Hastings could not be wonne.</note> friendſhip, and loue, had newly ſettled in the office of Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine to the young King) was euer faithfull and truſtie to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, and had vowed his heart to the ſeruice of his new maſter, inſomuch that the Protector was not aſſured whether he might attempt to winne him to ioine with himſelfe and with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in his conſpiracie, or no. But in the end hee fearing leſt he could not doe that miſchiefe ſafely, except the ſaid Lord were either wonne or deſtroied, hee reſolued vpon one of them. Wherefore firſt of all by liberall gifts, and by large promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of extraordinarie aduancement and preferment, hee wonne to his will one <hi>Catesbie,</hi> who was both wittie, and well learned in the Lawes of this Realme, and was the moſt inward of all others with the ſaid Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> from whom hee had receiued his beſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and his chiefeſt meanes to gaine.

Which when he treacherouſly and craftily had done, he informed the Protector that there was no poſſibilitie euer to winne him thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Protector reſoluing to cut him ſhort,<note place="margin">A plot full of villanie.</note> called a Grand Counſell of the Lords at the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> propoſing to them for their taske the conſideration of all fitting preparations for the ſpeedie Coronation of the King, when as indeed hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>The Lords being aſſembled, and ſet downe in their places, and all of them long expecting the repaire of the Protector, who ſtaied long, at length he came in, tooke his chaire, ſaluted them all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, excuſed his long abſence, merily ieſted with ſome of them, and was more then ordinarily pleaſant with them all. But aſſoone as he had propoſed ſome method to their preſent conference he told
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:14635:168"/>
Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elie,</hi> whom he loued not, that hee was informed that he had ſtore of Straberies in his Garden in <hi>Holborne,</hi> and intreated him to ſend for ſome, which with all expedition he did, being much gladded that he found the Protector (as hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued) ſo kinde towards him. But (behold) vnexpectedly and vpon a ſudden the Protector (faining ſome neceſſitie of a ſhort ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) roſe vp, and requeſted the Lords to proceed in the matter which then they had in hand, and promiſed to make a quicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, which within one houre after hee performed accordingly. But being placed in his chaire, the Lords perceiued that ſome things were amiſſe: for he bent his browes, bit his lippe, caſt his eies vpon the ground, wrung his fiſts, looked fiercely, ſighed deepely, and by euery vnpleaſing geſture he openly expreſſed the diſquieted paſſions of a troubled minde. The Lords (who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on him ſadly, and were perplexed with ſudden perturbations) wondred much at this ſudden change, but knew not what it meant. And when a profound ſilence had prepared them all to hearken what would be ſaid, the Protector by way of queſtioning propoſed what they deſerued who wickedly had intended and practiſed his deſtruction, hee being Vncle and Protector to the King? The Lords (who were all free and abſolutely guiltleſſe of any ſuch crime) ſate ſtill as men amazed, and not one of them ſpake a word. But at length the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (who by reaſon of his great familiaritie with the Protector, imagined that hee was higheſt in his fauour) anſwered thus: My Lord, ſuch as haue ſo tranſgreſſed the Law, deſerue the ſeuereſt puniſhments which by the Law may be inflicted vpon them, and all the Lords aſſented thereunto.<note place="margin">A likely matter.</note> Then quoth the Protector, that Sorcereſſe (meaning the Queene) and that Strumpet <hi>Shores</hi> wife, haue conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by witchcraft to depriue me of my life: and that you may be right well aſſured that it is true, behold (I pray you) and ſee how their villanie hath alreadie ſeiſed vpon my bodie. For by it my left arme is alreadie waſted and conſumed, and therewithall hee ſtroke vp his ſleeue, and ſhewed his arme naked before them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all. Thus dared hee to doe, albeit that all ſuch as were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent were well aſſured that his arme had neuer beene otherwiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from his mothers wombe. And moreouer, no man was ſo full of follie to beleeue that if the Queene had intended ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,<note place="margin">Shores wife was King Edwards Concubine.</note> ſhee would haue conſorted with <hi>Shores</hi> wife aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women, becauſe ſhee was the Concubine of King <hi>Edward</hi> her deceaſed husband. And beſides all this, they all knew that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Queene was religious, temperate, milde, charitable, and vertuous

in all her actions, hating to reuenge although meanes and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie were offered vnto her to doe miſchiefe.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (who after King <hi>Edwards</hi> death,<note place="margin">The Lord Haſtings pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his whoredome.</note> conuerſed with <hi>Shores</hi> wife; vſing her as his Concubine; and but the ſame Morning leauing her in his owne bed) being deſirous (if he might) to appeaſe the Protectors rage towards her: And (in ſome ſort) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to excuſe her, Replied thus, My Lord, if the Queene and ſhee haue ſo done, and therewithall the Protectors indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (waxing intemperate) interrupted him, thus: Thou Traitor (quoth hee) telleſt thou me of Iffs and Ands; I tell thee they haue done it, and as he ſpake thoſe words with a lowd voice, hee clapt his hand rudely vpon the Table board;<note place="margin">Armed men.</note> vpon the noyſe whereof, the whole Chamber was ſuddenly ſtuffed and filled with Armed men.

                  <p>And it is to be noted, that this Execution was thus done on him the ſame day, and at the ſame hower, that the Earle <hi>Ryuers,</hi> the Lord <hi>Richard Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> and their other friends, were executed without legall proceeding in the Caſtle of <hi>Pomfret:</hi>

                  <p>This frumpe and ſome others ſo pinched him at the heart, and the Deuill tooke ſuch an aduantage of him, by reaſon of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and wicked minde, that he ſuppoſed he could neuer be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and truly honoured as a King, ſo long as his two harmeleſſe and poore nephewes drew any breath, as though ſo horrible and ſo execrable and bloudie a murder could winne him loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among his diſcontented people.<note place="margin">The two yong Princes are murdered.</note>

lodged one <hi>Iames Terril,</hi> a man who was needie both in vertue, and of good meanes, to ſupport his haughtie and his ambitious minde, and who was likely (for rewards and promotions ſake) to kill his owne father and his friend.

                  <p>Thus when he had made him pliant to his will, he then by his letters required the Lieu-tenant to deliuer to him the keies of the Tower, which he forthwith did.

                  <p>The newes which proclaimed that the two young Princes were vnfortunately found dead in their bed, ſo amazed the Nobles and the common people of this Kingdome, and ſo inwardly perplexed the dying Queene, that euery place returned Ecchoes of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and of ſorrow, and euery mans eies ſent forth ſtreames of teares in token of their griefe.

                  <p>With theſe, and with ſome others he marched Eaſtwards, and came as farre as the Citie of <hi>Exeter,</hi> where hee vſed manie perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue and rethoricall arguments, and ſpeeches, to incite the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, voluntarily to become his ſubiects, and to ſurrender the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie into his hands. But finding that the fidelitie of the Cittizens was conſtant and vnremoueable from their King: And that their reſolutions (to indure extremities, if otherwiſe they could not be auoided) was ſtrongly ſetled and vnchangeable, they beſieged the Citie round about. And becauſe they wanted artillerie, and great Ordinance to make batteries vpon their walles: therefore (with Ladders, Crookes, Ropes, and other Engines,) they deſperately attempted to ſcale them in manie places, at one inſtant. But ſtill and euery where (with manlike Courage and with approoued Valour) they were repulſed, ouerborne, and tumbled into the Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and deepe Trenches, with which that Citie is enuironed on all parts.

                  <p>This ſtratagem of warre (becauſe it was vnuſuall) did at the firſt ſomewhat abaſh the Cittizens. But they (conſidering with

themſelues, that baſe cowardlineſſe was the betraier of true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that perfect valour deſpaired not in any danger) aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the hearts of vndaunted men, and by their endeuourous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and imploiments, they ceaſed not to prouide for their owne preſent ſafetie: inſomuch that with fire they encountred fire, and made greater fires within their Gates then the Rebels did without, which they maintained by adding ſtore of matter and of fewell for a long time, vntill that with rampiers, bankes, bulwarks, and other defenſiue fortifications, they had ſecured thoſe places from the entrie of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>When this their practiſe auailed not, then they againe buſied the Citizens with daily ſcalings and climings againſt their walles.

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14635:204"/>
whatſoeuer, as hee ſhould doe in her, if by the lawes of God and Man ſhee might remayne his wife: and therefore, for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of that queſtion, and for the quieting of his troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he inſtantly importuned a quick diſpatch and a finall end.<note place="margin">He deſireth a quick end.</note> Then was the Queen demanded, whether ſhee would ſtick to her appeale or no? who anſwered yea: yet (for all that) the Court proceeded weekly (though ſafely) as before.</p>
